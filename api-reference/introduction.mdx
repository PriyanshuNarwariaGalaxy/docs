## Overview

The Galaxy AI API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://workflow-priyanshu-y2um.vercel.app/api/openapi
```

## Authentication

<Note>
  All API endpoints require authentication using Bearer tokens.
</Note>

Include your API token in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

<Warning>
  Keep your API tokens secure. Do not share them in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, or public repositories.
</Warning>

## Response Codes

The API uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of requests:

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `200` | Success - The request completed successfully |
| `400` | Bad Request - Invalid input data |
| `401` | Unauthorized - Missing or invalid authentication |
| `403` | Forbidden - Insufficient permissions |
| `404` | Not Found - Resource doesn't exist |
| `500` | Internal Server Error - Something went wrong on our end |

## Error Response Format

When an error occurs, the API returns a consistent error format:

```json
{
  "message": "Error description",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE",
  "issues": []
}
```

## Rate Limits

API requests are rate limited to ensure fair usage. If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

<Tip>
  Use the API playground below each endpoint to test requests directly from the documentation.
